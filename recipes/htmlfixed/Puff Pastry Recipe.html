<h3>Preparation</h3>
<ol class="recipe-steps" itemprop="recipeInstructions">
<li>Mix the butter with three-quarter cup of the premeasured flour. This can be done in the bowl of an electric mixer using the flat paddle, in a food processor or by hand. The mixture should be smooth.</li>
<li>Form into a square one-inch thick, wrap in plastic wrap and chill for about 30 minutes.</li>
<li>Mix the salt with the remaining flour and add the cream. Mix well, by hand or in an electric mixer. Dough should not be sticky, but it will not be completely smooth.</li>
<li>On a floured board, roll the cream mixture into a rectangle slightly wider than the butter square and twice as long. Use flour sparingly as you go along, to make the dough easier to handle.</li>
<li>Place the butter square on the center of the cream mixture, seal the edges and roll into a thick rectangle about 12 inches by 16 inches. Chill at this point for about 30 minutes.</li>
<li>Roll the dough into a long rectangle, one-half-inch thick, taking care not to overwork it. Fold into thirds, matching edges and brushing off excess flour. Wrap and chill for 30 minutes. One turn has been completed.</li>
<li>Continue this process five more times. Dough will then be ready for use. It is important to let the dough rest in between turns in the refrigerator. Chilling may be speeded up by putting the dough in the freezer until it is chilled. The finished dough will keep for two days in the refrigerator. Unused pastry may be frozen.</li>
