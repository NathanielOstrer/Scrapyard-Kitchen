<h3>Preparation</h3>
<ol class="recipe-steps" itemprop="recipeInstructions">
<li>Preheat the broiler to high.</li>
<li>Cut each rack crosswise into eight flat medallions, each about half an inch thick. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Set aside.</li>
<li>Rub the slabs of lamb bones with curry powder, using about 2 teaspoons on each slab. Arrange the slabs on a flat baking dish.</li>
<li>Heat the butter in a heavy skillet large enough to hold the pieces of meat in one layer. Add the medallions and cook without crowding until nicely browned on one side, about 45 seconds to one minute. Turn and cook on the second side about the same length of time. Transfer the pieces of meat to a warm serving dish.</li>
<li>Place the slabs of bones under the broiler and let brown as you continue making the sauce. Broil about 2 1/2 minutes on each side.</li>
<li>Add the onion and remaining tablespoon of curry powder to the butter remaining in the skillet in which the medallions cooked. Cook, stirring, until onion is wilted. Add the broth and any juices that have accumulated around the pieces of meat. Cook about 2 minutes or until the sauce has thickened slightly. Add the cream and cook briefly, about one minute.</li>
<li>Line a saucepan with a sieve, preferably of the sort known in French kitchens as a chinois. Pour in the sauce. Press, using a plastic or rubber spatula, to extract most of the juices from the solids. There should be about two-thirds of a cup of sauce.</li>
<li>Pour the sauce into the center of a hot serving dish and surround the sauce with the medallions of meat.</li>
<li>Remove the slabs of bones and cut between each bone. Arrange the bones over the sauce. Serve with rice.</li>
