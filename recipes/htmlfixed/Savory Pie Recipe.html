<h3>Preparation</h3>
<ol class="recipe-steps" itemprop="recipeInstructions">
<li>Combine water and yeast in a mixing bowl and stir until yeast dissolves. Stir in 1 cup of flour. Stir in salt and a second cup of flour. Sprinkle some of the remaining flour over a work surface and your hands. Scrape dough out of the bowl and onto work surface. Gradually knead in additional flour, until dough no longer feels sticky.</li>
<li>Coat large bowl with olive oil. Shape dough into ball and rotate in the bowl to coat with oil. Cover bowl tightly with plastic wrap and set in warm, draft-free place until doubled in bulk, about 1 hour. Punch dough down and knead for about 1 minute. Return dough to bowl and let rise until doubled again, about 45 minutes. Punch down dough.</li>
<li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Lightly flour back of baking sheet and place dough on it. Roll dough into 12-inch circle, letting dough rest for a few minutes when it becomes too elastic to roll. Place filling in the center of dough and spread out, leaving a 2-inch border. Fold edge of the dough in over filling, making a pleat every 2 inches.</li>
<li>Brush rim of pie with egg mixture. Bake until lightly browned and cooked through, about 25 minutes. Let cool slightly, cut into wedges and serve.</li>
