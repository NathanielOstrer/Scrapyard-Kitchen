<h3>Preparation</h3>
<ol class="recipe-steps" itemprop="recipeInstructions">
<li>Heat oven to 350 degrees. Lightly oil 2 12-cup muffin tins. Finely crumble biscuits and cornbread into a large bowl with your hands; set aside.</li>
<li>Melt 8 tablespoons (1 stick) butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add onions and cook, stirring occasionally, until starting to soften, about 5 minutes. Add celery and cook 4 more minutes. Stir in sage and chestnuts and season with salt and pepper to taste; transfer to the bowl with biscuit and cornbread crumbs.</li>
<li>Melt remaining 4 tablespoons butter in skillet over medium-high heat. Add
mushrooms and cook, stirring occasionally, until they have released most of their liquid and are beginning to brown, about 8 minutes; remove to the bowl with onion mixture and crumbs.</li>
<li>Add eggs and 2 cups turkey broth to bowl and stir until everything is well-combined and moist. The mixture should hold together when squeezed in your hand. Add up to 1/2 cup more broth if mixture is too dry.</li>
<li>Form mixture into 3-inch balls with your hands. Flatten balls slightly between your palms, then set them in prepared muffin tins. Use your thumb or fingers to form a dimple in the top of each. Fill dimples with turkey broth. Transfer to oven and bake until the tops are browned and starting to crisp, about 40 minutes. Serve alongside turkey, drizzled with gravy if you like, or wrap the patties individually if serving as a portable snack.</li>

<span class="recipe-note-description">For best results, use a corn bread recipe that does not include sugar; it is also more authentic to use a recipe for corn bread baked in a cast-iron skillet.</span>
