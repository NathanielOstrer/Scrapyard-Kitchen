<h3>Preparation</h3>
<ol class="recipe-steps" itemprop="recipeInstructions">
<li>At least a day ahead of serving, shape the gelato into balls by arranging 5 squares of plastic wrap on a countertop and placing a portion of the gelato in the center of each. Bring the wrap around each and twist together to enclose. Mold each into a ball (the shape doesn't have to be perfect at this point), unwrap and push a cherry into each center. Rewrap. Place the balls on a baking sheet and freeze for at least 6 hours, rounding out the shape for the first hour. Remove plastic wrap from balls after about 2 hours.</li>
<li>For the ganache coating, melt the chocolate in the top of a double boiler over simmering water and whisk in 1/2 cup heavy cream until completely smooth. Remove from the heat and cool completely. (Do not refrigerate.) The mixture should be about 70 degrees and will be thick enough to make a ribbon on itself when the whisk is lifted.</li>
<li>Line a baking sheet with waxed paper. Working with one ball at a time, dip into the ganache to coat. Immediately sprinkle with some hazelnuts. Freeze 2 hours to harden and then store in a covered container in freezer until ready to serve.</li>
<li>To serve, warm the remaining 1/4 cup of heavy cream and whisk into remaining ganache. Add the remaining hazelnuts. Serve as a sauce for tartuffo.</li>
