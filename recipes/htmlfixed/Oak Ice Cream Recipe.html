<h3>Preparation</h3>
<ol class="recipe-steps" itemprop="recipeInstructions">
<li>Prepare an ice cream maker according to manufacturer’s directions.</li>
<li>In a medium saucepan, combine the milk, cream and oak shavings. Place over high heat and bring to a boil, watching carefully to keep from boiling over, then reduce heat to low and simmer for 5 minutes. Remove from heat and let mixture infuse for 45 minutes. </li>
<li>Strain through a thin mesh colander or strainer into a heatproof bowl; discard oak shavings. Return mixture to a clean medium saucepan over very low heat.</li>
<li>Using an electric mixer at medium speed, whisk together the granulated sugar, turbinado sugar, honey, salt and egg yolks until almost doubled in volume, about 2 minutes. Add 1/3 of the warm oak-infused liquid and mix just until combined well, about 30 seconds.</li>
<li>Return sugar and egg mixture to the saucepan of warm oak-infused milk, and gently stir in an “S” shape, taking care to scrape the bottom of the pan. Mixture will be ready when it appears silky and has thickened so that it coats the back of a wooden spoon.</li>
<li>Remove mixture from heat and set aside. Fill a large bowl with water and ice; place saucepan in it and cool to room temperature, stirring occasionally to ensure even cooling. Freeze mixture in an ice cream maker according to manufacturer’s directions, about 35 to 40 minutes.</li>
<li>Finished ice cream will have the consistency of soft serve and should be served immediately or promptly placed in freezer to help solidify. Serve within 2 days for best results.</li>
