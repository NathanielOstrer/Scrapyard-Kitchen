<h3>Preparation</h3>
<ol class="recipe-steps" itemprop="recipeInstructions">
<li>In a large mixing bowl, combine yeast, granulated sugar, milk and 1 cup lukewarm water. Mix well, sprinkle with 1 cup flour, and mix again until smooth. Cover and set aside in a warm place until batter is risen and foamy, about 45 minutes.</li>
<li>By hand, or using a mixer, mix egg yolks into batter one by one until well blended. Gradually add remaining 4 cups flour. Add 4 ounces melted butter and mix until batter is very smooth. Cover and set aside in a warm place until dough has doubled in size, about 1 hour. </li>
<li>Brush two baking sheets with melted butter. Heat oven to 375 degrees. Dust a work surface with flour, and divide dough into 12 portions. Shape each portion into a rope about 12 inches long, and brush lightly with melted butter. Coil gently but tightly to make a slightly rounded bun shape, tucking the inside end of the rope into the center of the bun, and the outside end under the bun. Place buns on baking sheets about 3 inches apart. Brush tops with butter, cover lightly, and set aside in a warm place until doubled in size, about 30 minutes. </li>
<li>Uncover buns and bake until light golden brown, 10 to 15 minutes. Transfer to a cooling rack and dust generously with confectioners’ sugar. Serve warm or at room temperature.</li>
