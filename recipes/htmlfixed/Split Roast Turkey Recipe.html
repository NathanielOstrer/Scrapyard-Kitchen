<h3>Preparation</h3>
<ol class="recipe-steps" itemprop="recipeInstructions">
<li>Heat the oven to 450. Use a sharp
knife to remove the turkey’s backbone. (Reserve the
backbone to make stock.) Turn the turkey
over, and press on it very hard to
flatten the breast; dislocate the thigh joint
where it meets the torso.</li>
<li>Put the bird breast side up in a large
roasting pan. The wings should partly
cover the breasts, and the legs should
protrude a bit. Tuck the garlic and
herbs under the bird’s skin and in the
nooks of the wings and legs; smear
with butter (or drizzle with olive oil), and
sprinkle liberally with salt and pepper.</li>
<li>Roast for 20 minutes, undisturbed.
Meanwhile, prepare the vegetables and
put them in a roasting pan and drizzle
with 3 tablespoons olive oil, salt, pepper
and some of the herbs; don’t crowd
the pan. Put in the oven.</li>
<li>If the turkey is browning too quickly,
reduce the oven temperature to 400;
begin to check it after about 55 minutes
of total cooking; it’s done when an
instant-read thermometer inserted
into the thickest part of the thigh
registers 155. Cook the vegetables until
slightly caramelized and soft; if
necessary, they can continue to cook
while the turkey rests before carving.</li>
<li>Separate the turkey’s legs from
the torso and slice; slice the breast as
well. Pass the meat on a platter with
the vegetables.</li>

<span class="recipe-note-description">Turn Stock Into Gravy

After removing the turkey and vegetables from your roasting pan, place on the stovetop over high heat. Deglaze the pan by pouring in 4 to 6 cups of turkey stock
and stirring to loosen any brown bits. Reduce the heat when
the mixture bubbles. Taste and adjust the seasoning; do not
skimp on salt or pepper. For every 4 to 6 cups of stock, mix
together 1/3 cup cornstarch and
1/4 cup water until smooth.
Add the cornstarch mixture to the gravy, stirring constantly. It
should thicken almost instantly; serve right away.</span>
