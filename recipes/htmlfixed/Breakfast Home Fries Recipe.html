<h3>Preparation</h3>
<ol class="recipe-steps" itemprop="recipeInstructions">
<li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Shred the potatoes and onions (in a food processor or with a hand-held shredder), place them in a large bowl, add the vegetable oil, salt and pepper, and mix well.</li>
<li>Oil 2 9-by-13-inch nonstick baking sheets and place the potato mixture on the sheets in 12 mounds. Flatten them to a thickness of 1/2 inch and form them into neat, round cakes. Bake for 30 minutes, or until the undersides of the cakes are browned. It is not necessary to turn the cakes. Remove them from the oven and allow to cool completely before lifting from the sheet.</li>
<li>Wrap the cakes individually, place them on a flat sheet, and freeze. To use, defrost two or more cakes in the microwave (or overnight in the refrigerator) and fry on both sides in butter, bacon fat or oil until nicely browned. Alternatively, put the frozen cakes directly onto the rack of a toaster oven set for dark and toast until browned but not dry in the center.</li>
