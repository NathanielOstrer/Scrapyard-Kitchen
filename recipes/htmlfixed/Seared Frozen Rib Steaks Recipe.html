<h3>Preparation</h3>
<ol class="recipe-steps" itemprop="recipeInstructions">
<li>Place the steaks on a baking sheet and freeze them for 1 hour.</li>
<li>Heat the oven to 200 degrees. Season the steaks all over generously with salt and pepper.</li>
<li>Heat a cast iron skillet until very hot, at least 10 minutes; add a thin layer of safflower oil. Sear the steaks, one at a time, on one side, until they form a golden crust. Transfer, seared side up, to a rimmed baking sheet. Alternatively, arrange steak on a rimmed baking sheet. Holding a propane torch six inches from the meat, run a flame back and forth across the surface of the meat, giving it an even crust. Make sure to sear the fatty edges and the bones. (You need to sear only one side and the edges.)</li>
<li>Cook steaks until they reach a core temperature of 122 degrees for rare, about 30 minutes to 1 hour. (Or leave it in the oven until it’s done to taste.) Let stand 10 minutes before thinly slicing. Sprinkle with coarse sea salt and serve immediately.</li>
