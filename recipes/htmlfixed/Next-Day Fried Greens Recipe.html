<h3>Preparation</h3>
<ol class="recipe-steps" itemprop="recipeInstructions">
<li>In a large pot, bring 3 quarts of water to a boil. Add neck bones and pigs’ tails, or smoked turkey wings or pork chop or ham hock, plus Savannah seasoning, red pepper, bacon grease and 4 tablespoons of butter. Reduce the heat to medium and simmer, uncovered, for 1 hour or until the meat is tender.</li>
<li>Meanwhile, remove the collard stems by holding each leaf in one hand and stripping the leaf down with the thumb and index finger of the other hand. Discard the stems.</li>
<li>Stack 7 or 8 leaves on top of one another, roll them up tight like a cigar and slice into 1/2-inch-wide strands. Repeat until you have cut all the leaves. Then wash the collards twice, shake them and drain in a large colander.</li>
<li>Add the collards to the stock, cover and simmer until they are tender. In the summer, they will cook in 45 minutes to an hour, but in winter, they will take only 30 to 45 minutes because the first frost will have tenderized them. Keep a close eye on them; you will know they are done when they are tender but not mushy. Near the end of the cooking, check the amount of liquid left in the pot. If there is too much, more than 1 cup, uncover the pot to cook down the liquid a bit.</li>
<li>Remove the meat from the bones and discard the bones. Return the meat to the greens and transfer to the refrigerator overnight.</li>
<li>The next day, melt the remaining 1 tablespoon butter in a skillet set over medium heat and add the onion. Cook for a few minutes until it just starts to soften, then add the greens, meat and cooked rice. There should be more greens than rice. Sauté over medium-high heat until the dish is heated through.</li>

              Tip
            </h4>
<ul class="recipe-notes">
<li>
<span class="recipe-note-description">To make Savannah seasoning, combine 1/2 cup Lawry’s seasoned salt, 1/4 cup kosher salt, 2 scant tablespoons granulated garlic or garlic powder and 1 tablespoon ground black pepper. Use on eggs and vegetables, or sprinkle over chicken or pork before cooking. Store in a tightly sealed glass jar.</span>
