<h3>Preparation</h3>
<ol class="recipe-steps" itemprop="recipeInstructions">
<li>Separate eggs, placing 5 yolks in a small bowl, and 4 whites in the bowl of an electric mixer; discard the fifth white, or reserve for another purpose. Whisk yolks just until blended, then set aside. Set whites aside at room temperature, or refrigerate if the souffle is to be served later in the day. Rinse lemons with warm water, and grate and reserve the zest.</li>
<li>In a small, heavy saucepan, combine 1 1/2 tablespoons of the sugar and the flour. Gradually stir in the milk, mixing until smooth. Place pan over medium heat, and stir constantly until mixture has boiled for 1 minute. Remove pan from heat. While whisking vigorously, slowly add several tablespoons of the hot milk mixture to the egg yolks. Add yolk mixture to saucepan over medium heat, and whisk just until the mixture is smooth and thick, and light yellow in color, 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
<li>Remove saucepan from heat. Add butter, and stir until it has melted. Stir in the reserved lemon zest, and set aside to cool. The mixture may be refrigerated at this point for up to 4 hours; bring to room temperature before baking.</li>
<li>Half an hour before serving, preheat oven to 400 degrees. Butter a 1 1/2-quart souffle dish and coat it with sugar. Place the bowl of egg whites over a bowl of hot water, and stir gently until they are barely warmed. Using an electric mixer at medium speed, whisk egg whites until foamy. Add the cream of tartar, and increase speed to medium-high. Gradually add remaining 4 tablespoons of sugar, whisking until whites are moderately stiff but not dry; they should have smooth soft peaks with very fine bubbles.</li>
<li>Add about 1/4 cup of the beaten egg whites to the yolk mixture, to loosen and smooth the yolks. Gently fold the yolk mixture into the remaining egg whites, until barely mixed. Pour into the souffle dish, and smooth the top. With the tip of a table knife, draw a circle about an inch in from the side of the dish, and an inch deep into the souffle mixture. Squeeze 1 to 2 teaspoons of lemon juice from one lemon. Trail juice over top of souffle, and sprinkle juice lightly with sugar.</li>
<li>Bake souffle until it has puffed and is golden brown on top, about 20 minutes. If souffle is browning too quickly, reduce heat to 375 degrees. Serve immediately.</li>
