<h3>Preparation</h3>
<ol class="recipe-steps" itemprop="recipeInstructions">
<li>Purée the ginger in a food processor. Place the purée in a piece of cheesecloth and, over a bowl, twist it to extract as much juice as possible -- you should get 2 teaspoons. Discard the pulp. Stir lime zest into the juice.</li>
<li>Gently peel back the skin on the pieces of chicken and rub the ginger-lime mixture over the meat. Replace the skin and pat it into place. Tie the wings to the breasts with kitchen twine. Let the chicken marinate at room temperature for 30 minutes.</li>
<li>Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the cilantro and cook for 30 seconds, then transfer to a bowl of ice water. Drain and pat dry. Put the leaves in a food processor, add 1/4 cup of the olive oil and pulse to a paste. With the processor running, add the remaining 3/4 cup oil. Season to taste with salt.</li>
<li>Bring 4 cups of water to a boil in the bottom of a steamer. Place the chicken in the top of the steamer basket, cover and steam until the chicken is nearly done, about 20 minutes. Transfer the chicken to a rack to dry.</li>
<li>Heat the grapeseed oil in a large skillet over medium heat until it is hot but not smoking. Brown the chicken on one side, then season it with salt and pepper, turn and brown it on the other side, seasoning it again.</li>
<li>To serve, place the chicken in the center of four serving plates (preferably white). Surround each serving with 1 1/2 tablespoons of the cilantro oil. (Reserve extra oil for another use.)</li>
