<h3>Preparation</h3>
<ol class="recipe-steps" itemprop="recipeInstructions">
<li>In a large nonreactive mixing bowl, combine short ribs, carrots, celery, thyme, bay leaves and peppercorns. Cut 4 of the onions into 1-inch chunks, and add to bowl. Cut 2 heads of garlic (with peel) in half crosswise, and add to bowl. Pour wine over all, and mix well. Cover, and refrigerate overnight.</li>
<li>Remove short ribs from marinade, and drain well. Pat dry with paper towels, and season with salt and pepper to taste. Set aside. Strain marinade into a clean bowl, reserving vegetables. Remove thyme, bay leaves and peppercorns, and reserve. In a large casserole over high heat, heat 2 tablespoons of duck fat, and add short ribs. Sear short ribs until well browned on all sides, about 10 minutes. Remove short ribs, and set aside.</li>
<li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Add 1 tablespoon of duck fat to casserole, then add the reserved vegetables. Saute, stirring constantly, until lightly browned, about 10 minutes. Add reserved marinade, and stir well. Boil marinade until reduced by half, about 15 minutes. Add veal stock, short ribs and reserved thyme, bay leaves and peppercorns. Cover, and braise in oven until ribs are very tender, about 2 1/2 hours.</li>
<li>Remove short ribs from casserole, and set aside. Pour vegetables and liquid through a fine strainer into a large bowl. Discard all solids, and return liquid to a clean casserole. Bring the liquid to a boil over high heat, and reduce by half, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat, and set aside.</li>
<li>Cut remaining 3 onions into large dice. Separate the cloves of the remaining head of garlic, and peel and thinly slice. In a large saute pan over medium-low heat, add remaining 1 tablespoon duck fat. Add mushrooms, and saute until lightly browned. Remove from pan, and set aside. Add diced onions to pan, and saute until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add sliced garlic to onions, and saute for 1 minute. Add mushrooms and prunes, and saute just until heated.</li>
<li>Add sauteed onion, garlic, prunes and mushrooms to the casserole containing the reduced wine mixture. Adjust salt and pepper to taste. Add short ribs, and mix gently. Place over medium-low heat, and simmer just until thoroughly heated. Serve immediately.</li>
