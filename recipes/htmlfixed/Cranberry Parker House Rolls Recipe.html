<h3>Preparation</h3>
<ol class="recipe-steps" itemprop="recipeInstructions">
<li>Use an electric mixer, fitted with dough hook if possible, or a paddle. In mixer's bowl, combine yeast with 1/4 cup tepid water and a pinch of sugar. Stir until yeast dissolves; let stand until mixture gets foamy, about 10 minutes.</li>
<li>Add milk, eggs and remaining 3 tablespoons sugar. Mix on a low speed until mixture is combined.</li>
<li>Add flour 1/2 cup at a time, mixing for several seconds after each addition. Sprinkle in the salt and mix until dough comes together in a ball, 3 to 5 minutes. With mixer running at a medium speed, add cubes of butter one at a time. Mix until butter is completely incorporated, and dough is glossy and comes away from sides of bowl, about 5 minutes.</li>
<li>Spray a bowl with nonstick cooking spray. Form dough into a loose ball and place it in bowl. Lightly spray plastic wrap and cover dough loosely with it. Allow dough to rest at room temperature for 2 1/2 hours, or until it has doubled in size.</li>
<li>While dough is rising, make cranberry butter. Place cranberries in a medium saucepan over a low heat. Add 1/2 cup water and sprinkle in the sugar. Simmer, stirring occasionally, for 30 minutes or until berries are mushy and water evaporates. Transfer to a bowl to cool.</li>
<li>Place softened butter in bowl of an electric mixer and beat on a low speed with paddle attachment. Add cranberries and beat until well combined. Keep butter covered with plastic wrap at room temperature until ready to use.</li>
<li>Lightly spray 2 (12-cup) muffin tins with nonstick cooking spray. When dough has doubled in size, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface and divide into 8 equal pieces. Roll each eighth into a 6-inch-long cylinder. Set one aside and cover remaining 7 cylinders with plastic wrap to prevent drying while you work.</li>
<li>Cut first cylinder into 6 equal round pieces about 1 inch thick. Roll each piece of dough into a ball and flatten with your hands into a 2 1/2-inch round. Spread a generous amount of cranberry butter (about 2 teaspoons) on the face of each round and place each in a muffin cup, butter side up. Repeat this process with second cylinder of dough, this time placing the rounds butter side down on top of rounds in tin. Using your thumb, gently press center of each roll, making an indentation in middle. Place a dot of cranberry butter in each indentation. Repeat with remaining dough. Loosely cover muffin tins with plastic wrap.</li>
<li>Allow rolls to rise until tops are puffed up to edge of muffin tin, about 30 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat oven to 350 degrees. Uncover and bake rolls until golden brown, about 22 to 28 minutes, or until golden brown on top. Turn rolls out of muffin tins. Serve warm with additional cranberry butter on the side.</li>

            </h4>
<ul class="recipe-notes">
