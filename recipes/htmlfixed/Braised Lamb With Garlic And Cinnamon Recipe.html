<h3>Preparation</h3>
<ol class="recipe-steps" itemprop="recipeInstructions">
<li>Put oil in a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat. A minute later, add as many chunks of lamb as will fit without crowding (cook in batches, if necessary). When meat browns (3 to 4 minutes) turn chunks and sprinkle them with salt and pepper. Adjust heat so pieces brown as rapidly as possible without burning. After each has browned on 2 sides, remove from pan and add another piece or two until all meat has been browned (10 to 15 minutes).</li>
<li>When all meat has been removed from pan, turn off heat and allow the pan to cool a bit. Turn heat back to medium and add garlic and cinnamon. Cook for about 30 seconds, then add the wine; raise heat to high and let wine bubble away for a minute. Add the tomatoes and cook, stirring occasionally, for about a minute. Return meat to pan and cover; adjust heat so mixture bubbles very gently. (If it cooks too quickly, you may have to add a little water.)</li>
<li>Cook, undisturbed, until meat is very tender, about 1 1/2 hours. Taste and adjust seasoning, then serve over rice or buttered noodles, with lemon wedges.</li>
