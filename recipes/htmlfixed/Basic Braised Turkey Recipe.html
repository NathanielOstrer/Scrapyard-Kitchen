<h3>Preparation</h3>
<ol class="recipe-steps" itemprop="recipeInstructions">
<li>Put the olive oil in a large skillet
over medium-high heat. Season the
turkey and brown the leg (and, if
you’re using them, wing) portions on the
skin side well, 10 minutes or more;
turn and cook for another 2 minutes on
the skinless side. Remove to a plate
and brown the breasts in the same
skillet, again mostly on the skin side;
remove and keep them separate.</li>
<li>Heat the oven to 300, and cook
the bacon or pancetta (if using) in the
remaining fat in the skillet until
nearly crisp; remove with a slotted spoon.
Cook the onions, mushrooms, carrots,
celery and herbs, in batches if
necessary, until beginning to brown,
10 to 12 minutes. Transfer with the
bacon or pancetta to a large roasting
pan, then nestle the dark meat in there,
leaving room for the breasts. Add
stock or water to come about one-third
to halfway up the sides of the thighs.</li>
<li>Roast uncovered for about 90 minutes,
checking occasionally to make sure
liquid levels remain sufficiently high and
stirring vegetables if they threaten to
brown too much. When thigh meat is
tender, place the breasts in the pan, and
cook until tender, 30 to 45 minutes
more, or until done. (They should register
155 on an instant-read thermometer.)</li>
<li>Slice breast and thigh meat and serve
on a platter with the vegetables
garnished, if you like, with parsley.</li>

<span class="recipe-note-description">At least one reader has expressed concern that a turkey will not be done if it does not reach an internal temperature of at least 165 degrees Fahrenheit, as recommended by the U.S.D.A. This recipe is in line with traditional levels of doneness and is intended to produce the best-tasting food. If the turkey is cooked to 155, its temperature will rise to 165 or higher while resting. Cooking to a temperature of 165 isn't unreasonable, but the turkey’s temperature will rise to 175 or 180 before serving, leaving it overdone. If you're most comfortable cooking to higher temperatures, feel free, but expect drier meat.</span>

<span class="recipe-note-description">How to Turn Stock Into Gravy

After removing the turkey and vegetables from your roasting pan, place on the stovetop over high heat. Deglaze the pan by pouring in 4 to 6 cups of turkey stock
and stirring to loosen any brown bits. Reduce the heat when
the mixture bubbles. Taste and adjust the seasoning; do not
skimp on salt or pepper. For every 4 to 6 cups of stock, mix
together 1/3 cup cornstarch and
1/4 cup water until smooth.
Add the cornstarch mixture to the gravy, stirring constantly. It
should thicken almost instantly; serve right away.</span>
