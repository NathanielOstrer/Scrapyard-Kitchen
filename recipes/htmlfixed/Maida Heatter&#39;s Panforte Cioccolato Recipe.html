<h3>Preparation</h3>
<ol class="recipe-steps" itemprop="recipeInstructions">
<li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Put the almonds in a shallow cake pan and bake them in the center of the oven, stirring once or twice, for 12 to 15 minutes. Set aside.</li>
<li>Move a rack to the lower third of the oven and lower the temperature to 325 degrees. Cut a round of parchment to fit the bottom of a nine-inch springform pan, two or three inches deep. Cut a strip (or two shorter strips) about an inch and a half wide to go around the sides of the pan. Butter the sides and bottom of the pan. First put the strip (or strips) around the sides of the pan, just touching the bottom and covering only part of the way up on the sides. Then put the round in the bottom of the pan. Butter the papers on the bottom and the sides, dust all over with fine dry bread crumbs, invert over paper to shake out excess crumbs and set the pan aside.</li>
<li>Put all the candied fruits in a large mixing bowl. Sift together over the fruit the flour, cocoa, cinnamon, allspice, white pepper and espresso or coffee powder. With your hands, mix the fruits with the dry ingredients, thoroughly separating and coating the pieces. Add the almonds and hazelnuts and mix again. Set aside.</li>
<li>Put the honey and sugar in a saucepan with a six-cup capacity over moderate heat. Stir with a wooden spatula until the sugar is dissolved and the mixture comes to a boil. Then insert a candy thermometer in the pan and let the mixture boil without stirring until the thermometer registers 248 degrees (stiff-ball stage); the mixture will reach this temperature soon after it comes to a boil.</li>
<li>Now you must work very quickly before the hot syrup cools and hardens. Pour the syrup onto the fruit mixture, stir with a heavy wooden spatula to mix, and -- without waiting -- transfer the mixture to the prepared pan (there will be just barely enough syrup to moisten the dry ingredients).</li>
<li>Immediately cover with a piece of plastic wrap and press down on the top with your hands to press the mixture into an even layer. Then use a can or a small saucepan or any round and flat piece of equipment to press down very firmly on the top to form a compact layer. Quickly remove the plastic wrap.</li>
<li>Bake for 40 minutes. (You will not know by looking or testing that the cake is done; it will become firm as it cools.) Do not overbake.</li>
<li>Set aside to cool. When the cake is completely cool and firm, remove the sides of the pan and the paper strip (or strips) on the sides. Cover the cake with a rack and turn upside down. Remove the bottom of the pan and the paper lining on the bottom.</li>
<li>Place the cake upside down on a length of wax paper. Through a fine strainer, generously sprinkle on confectioner's sugar, forming a thick coating. Then carefully turn the cake right side up and sprinkle sugar on that side also. There should be a generous amount of sugar on both sides.</li>
<li>Wrap the cake in airtight plastic wrap and let it stand at room temperature for days, if you wish, or a week or two (or freeze).</li>
<li>To cut into portions, unwrap the room-temperature cake, re-sugar if necessary and, using a long, sharp, heavy knife, cut straight down across the top, then cut each half into eight wedges.</li>

<span class="recipe-note-description">You can use candied fruit that you buy already diced, or you can buy the large pieces and dice them yourself. If you dice them yourself, cut the pieces about one-fourth-inch square. You can also buy almonds that are already blanched and toasted.</span>
