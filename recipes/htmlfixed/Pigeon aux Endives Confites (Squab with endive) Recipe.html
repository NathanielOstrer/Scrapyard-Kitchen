<h3>Preparation</h3>
<ol class="recipe-steps" itemprop="recipeInstructions">
<li>Trim off the ends of the endives and separate the leaves.</li>
<li>Bring enough water to the boil to cover the endive leaves when they are added. Add the endives and cover. Cook exactly four minutes and drain well.</li>
<li>Heat the butter in a large, heavy skillet and when it is very hot add the endive. Sprinkle with salt, pepper and sugar. Cook over high heat, stirring and shaking the skillet so that the endive cooks evenly all over. The liquid will start to evaporate and the vegetable will become amber colored. Cook about 20 minutes or until the endives are caramel colored all over. Do not burn. Drain in a colander.</li>
<li>Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 525 degrees.</li>
<li>Cut off the wing tips and the second wing joints of each squab. Set these pieces aside.</li>
<li>Heat a heavy skillet large enough to hold the squabs in one layer without crowding.</li>
<li>Add the squabs and brown them on all sides, turning them often so that they brown evenly. Add the wing tips and second wing joints. Place in the oven and reduce the oven heat to 425 degrees. Bake 15 minutes. The squabs will be slightly undercooked. Transfer the squabs to a warm platter. Pour off the fat from the skillet. Set the skillet aside.</li>
<li>Spoon equal portions of the endives on each of four hot plates.</li>
<li>Carefully carve away the breast and leg meat from each side of the carcasses. Save the carcasses. Arrange two squab halves on each bed of endive.</li>
<li>Chop the carcasses into small pieces with a heavy cleaver. Add these pieces to the skillet and cook over moderately high heat until well browned. Add the water and cook down to about one-quarter cup. Pour the liquid over the squabs and serve.</li>
