<h3>Preparation</h3>
<h4 class="group-name">For the basic steamed long-grain rice</h4>
<ol class="recipe-steps" itemprop="recipeInstructions">
<li>Place the rice in a bowl in the sink, and rinse and drain several times with water, until the water runs clear. If using basmati rice, soak for 30 minutes. Drain over a bowl, and measure out 1 1/2 to 2 cups water.</li>
<li>Combine the water, rice and salt in a heavy 2- or 3-quart saucepan with a tight-fitting lid. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat to low and cover. Simmer 12 to 15 minutes, until all of the liquid has been absorbed.</li>
<li>Uncover the rice, and place a clean kitchen towel over the top of the pan (it should not be touching the rice). Replace the lid, and allow to sit for ten minutes undisturbed. Serve.</li>
</ol>

              Tip
            </h4>
<ul class="recipe-notes">
<li>
<span class="recipe-note-description">Variations:

* Here is a typically Middle Eastern way to prepare pilaf. Proceed with step 1 as instructed. Heat 1 to 2 tablespoons butter or oil in a heavy 2- or 3-quart saucepan over medium heat. Add 1/4 to 1/2 cup finely chopped onion if desired, and cook, stirring, until it begins to soften, about three minutes. Add the rice, and cook, stirring, for two to three minutes, until the rice is sizzling and the grains are separate. Add the water and salt, and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat, cover and simmer 12 to 15 minutes, until all of the liquid has been absorbed. Proceed with step 3.

* Substitute chicken or vegetable stock for the water.

Advance preparation: Rice can be cooked ahead and reheated. One you have followed the recipe through step 3, spread the rice in a lightly oiled 2-quart baking dish and allow to cool completely, uncovered. To reheat, cover with foil and place in a 325-degree oven for 20 minutes.
