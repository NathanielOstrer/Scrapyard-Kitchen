<h3>Preparation</h3>
<ol class="recipe-steps" itemprop="recipeInstructions">
<li>To make the ice cream, pick through the mint leaves, discarding any leaves that are dried or blackened. Place the mint and a quarter cup of sugar in the bowl of a food processor or blender. Process until pureed. Set aside.</li>
<li>Bring the half-and-half just to a boil in a three-quart saucepan. Remove from the heat and add the mint puree. Cover and steep for 30 minutes.</li>
<li>Return the half-and-half mixture to the heat and bring just to a boil. In the meantime, whisk together the egg yolks and remaining half cup of sugar in a large mixing bowl. Once the half-and-half comes to a boil, remove it from the heat and pour it slowly into the yolk mixture, stirring constantly.</li>
<li>Once blended, return the mint mixture to the saucepan and heat slowly over medium-low heat. Using a rubber spatula, stir constantly for six to eight minutes, until the mixture coats the back of the spatula. At this point, remove from the heat immediately. Pour the mixture into a large mixing bowl and cool it down over an ice bath, or in cold water, stirring constantly. Once cooled, chill it completely in the refrigerator. When cold, process in an ice cream maker according to the manufacturer's directions. Add the chocolate chips just before removing the ice cream, stirring long enough to just scatter them throughout the ice cream. Keep in the freezer until you're ready to assemble the sandwiches.</li>
<li>To make the ganache, melt the chocolate and butter in the top part of a double boiler. Once melted, remove from the heat and stir in the heavy cream and brandy. Let it cool and thicken before spreading on the chocolate-almond macaroons.</li>
<li>For the macaroons, preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Butter and flour three cookie sheets. Set aside.</li>
<li>Melt the chocolate in the top part of a double boiler. When done, remove from the heat.</li>
<li>Beat the egg whites with the cream of tartar until they hold a firm peak. Gradually beat in the sugar, a quarter of a cup at a time, until all of it is completely incorporated. Add the egg yolk and blend.</li>
<li>Fold a third of the whipped egg whites into the chocolate using a spatula. Blend in the ground almonds. Fold in the remaining egg whites.</li>
<li>Fit a half-inch pastry tip into a pastry bag. Scoop the cookie mixture into the bag. Press out half-inch mounds of batter, one-inch apart, onto the prepared cookie sheet. (You can spoon the mixture onto the sheets with a teaspoon as well.)</li>
<li>Bake the cookies for four to five minutes, until they puff and the edges are slightly wrinkled. Remove from the oven to cool (about five minutes). Remove the cookies with a spatula onto a flat plate. There are extra cookies in case some break.</li>
<li>To prepare the ice cream sandwiches, spread the top half of the cookies with the ganache and set aside. Brush the ganache on the bottoms of the remaining cookies. Sandwich the ice cream in between, placing the uncoated bottom on the plate.</li>
