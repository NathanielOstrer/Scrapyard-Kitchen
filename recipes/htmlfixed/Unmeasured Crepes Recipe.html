<h3>Preparation</h3>
<ol class="recipe-steps" itemprop="recipeInstructions">
<li>Beat the eggs. Add the rest of the ingredients, and whisk. Add a bit of salt, 
and taste. If you don’t want to taste the eggs raw, heat a pan, drizzle a bit of 
the batter into it, then taste it cooked.</li>
<li>Heat a nonstick pan, or put a lightly oiled one over medium heat. Add a 
ladleful of batter, just enough to thinly coat the bottom of the pan. Cook until the edges just begin to brown, probably about 30 seconds. Flip — this is not at all delicate, though it seems as though it should be — and cook about 10 seconds.</li>
<li>Cook as many crepes as you want, stacking them on a plate and covering them with a cloth towel until you’re ready to eat. Serve with a whole array of 
things you might like to put in them.</li>
