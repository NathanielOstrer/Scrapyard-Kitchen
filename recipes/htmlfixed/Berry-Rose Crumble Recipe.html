<h3>Preparation</h3>
<ol class="recipe-steps" itemprop="recipeInstructions">
<li>Hull the strawberries. If they’re large, cut them in half. In a large bowl, toss the fruit with the sugar, rose water and (optional) cornstarch or arrowroot. Cover and let stand for 15 to 30 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 350 degrees, and butter a two-quart baking dish.</li>
<li>Transfer the fruit to the baking dish, making sure to scrape all of the liquid into the bowl. Set the baking dish on a baking sheet for easier handling, and place in the oven for 15 minutes. Remove from the oven, and spread the crumble topping over the fruit in an even layer. Return to the oven for 15 to 20 minutes until the crumble is bubbling and nicely browned. Allow to stand for at least 15 minutes before serving.</li>

<ul class="recipe-notes">

<span class="recipe-note-description">Advance preparation: The crumble topping keeps for several months in the freezer. Bake the fruit without the crumble topping as instructed in Step 2, then allow it to sit for a few hours before you finish it with the crumble topping. This makes a great leftover; I did not tire of it for the five days that it lasted in my refrigerator.</span>
