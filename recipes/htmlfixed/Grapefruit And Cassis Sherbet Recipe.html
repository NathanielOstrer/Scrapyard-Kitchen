<h3>Preparation</h3>
<ol class="recipe-steps" itemprop="recipeInstructions">
<li>Carefully peel and section the grapefruit over a bowl, saving the juice. Cut away and discard all the outer white membrane and connecting membrane. To section them, run a knife between each segment. Discard any seeds. There should be about three cups of flesh and one cup of juice.</li>
<li>Combine the grapefruit sections and juice in a food processor or blender and blend as thoroughly as possible. There should be about three and one-third cups. Put the mixture in a mixing bowl.</li>
<li>Combine the sugar with two cups of water in a saucepan and bring to a boil. Cook about five minutes and cool completely. Add to the grapefruit mixture and blend. There should be about five and one-half cups. Add the cassis and chill thoroughly.</li>
<li>Pour the mixture into an electric or hand-cranked ice-cream freezer and freeze according to the manufacturer's instructions. When the mixture starts to freeze, add the egg white and continue freezing to the desired consistency.</li>
