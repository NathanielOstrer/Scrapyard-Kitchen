<h3>Preparation</h3>
<ol class="recipe-steps" itemprop="recipeInstructions">
<li>In a large nonreactive mixing bowl, combine short ribs, 1/2 cup of hoisin sauce and 1 cup of wine. Mix well. Cover, and refrigerate overnight.</li>
<li>Remove short ribs from marinade, and set aside. In a covered casserole or roasting pan large enough to hold the ribs in a single layer, combine marinade and 3 cups of water. Bring to a boil over high heat. Add ribs and peppercorns. Reduce heat to low, cover pan and simmer until very tender, about 2 1/2 hours.</li>
<li>While ribs are simmering, in a small nonreactive saucepan combine the remaining 1 cup of zinfandel with remaining 2 tablespoons of hoisin sauce. Place over low heat, and simmer until reduced to 1/2 cup. Remove from heat, and reserve.</li>
<li>When short ribs are tender, use a slotted spoon to transfer to a deep serving platter. Set aside the ribs, and keep warm. Place the pan of marinade over high heat, and boil until thick and syrupy. Whisk in enough of the reserved hoisin-wine reduction to make a well-balanced sauce. Add salt to taste. Pour sauce over the short ribs, and serve immediately.</li>
