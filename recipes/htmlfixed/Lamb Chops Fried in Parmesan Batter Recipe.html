<h3>Preparation</h3>
<ol class="recipe-steps" itemprop="recipeInstructions">
<li>Turn the chops on both sides in the grated Parmesan, pressing the chop firmly against the crumbs, using the palm of your hands to make the cheese adhere to the meat. Tap the chops gently against the plate to shake off excess cheese. Dip them into the beaten egg, letting the excess flow back into the dish. Turn  the chops in the bread crumbs, coating both sides, and tap them again to shake off excess.</li>
<li>Pour enough oil in a skillet to come 1/4 inch up the sides, and turn on the heat to medium. When the oil is very hot, slip as many chops into the pan as will fit without crowding. When one side forms a nice golden crust, sprinkle it with salt and pepper, turn the chop and sprinkle salt and pepper on the other side. As soon as the second side has formed a crust, transfer to a warm platter, using a slotted spoon or spatula. Repeat the procedure, slipping more chops into the pan as soon as there is room for them. When all the 
chops are done, serve promptly. 
</li>

              Tip
            </h4>
<ul class="recipe-notes">
<li>
<span class="recipe-note-description">* If possible, have a butcher knock off
the corner bone and remove the backbone,
leaving just the rib. Flatten the eye of
the lamb chop with a meat pounder. (If you
don’t have a butcher to remove the
bones, you’ll still be able to flatten the
meat a bit with a pounder. It will remain a
little thicker, so the chops will take an
extra minute or two to cook.)</span>
