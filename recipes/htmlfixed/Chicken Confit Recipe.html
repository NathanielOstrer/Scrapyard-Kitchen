<h3>Preparation</h3>
<ol class="recipe-steps" itemprop="recipeInstructions">
<li>Heat oven to 300 degrees. Put chicken in a pan just large enough to fit it comfortably and deep enough for oil to completely cover chicken. Add remaining ingredients. Place on stovetop over medium-high heat, and cook only until bubbles come up.</li>
<li>Transfer pan to oven, uncovered. Cook for about two hours; oil should be bubbling, but just barely; adjust oven heat as necessary. When done, meat can be easily pierced with a thin-bladed knife. Cool slightly, then remove chicken from oil. Strain and reserve oil for another use (store in refrigerator). Meat may be refrigerated for several days before using.</li>
<li>To reheat, put 2 tablespoons reserved oil into a skillet over medium heat. Add chicken and cook on both sides until nicely browned, 15 minutes. Serve hot or at room temperature, preferably on a bed of dressed greens.</li>
