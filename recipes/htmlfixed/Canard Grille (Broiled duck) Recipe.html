<h3>Preparation</h3>
<ol class="recipe-steps" itemprop="recipeInstructions">
<li>Cut the duck or have it cut as follows: Cut off the thighs with legs attached. Cut off the wing tips and reserve, along with the carcass, for soup. Cut off the second wing joint. Cut off the two breast portions (with the main wing bones attached) from the carcass. Trim around the breast and thigh portions to cut away all peripheral skin, that is to say the outer edges.</li>
<li>Put the breasts, thighs, second wing joints, neck, liver and gizzard in a large bowl.</li>
<li>Chop the bay leaf as finely as possible on a flat surface. Put the chopped bay leaf in a small mixing bowl and add salt and pepper to taste and the oil. Mix well. Rub the duck pieces with the mixture and let stand until ready to cook.</li>
<li>When ready to cook, arrange the breast, thigh and leg and wing portions skin side up in one layer in a flat baking dish. Add the neck, liver and gizzard so that they, too, will be exposed to the broiler heat.</li>
<li>If the broiler and oven have separate temperature controls, preheat broiler to high and oven to 425 degrees. If they have the same temperature control, preheat broiler to high.</li>
<li>Place duck under the broiler about three or four inches from the source of heat. Broil about five minutes until skin is golden brown. Turn the pieces.</li>
<li>Broil duck on second side about five minutes or until golden brown.</li>
<li>If the broiler and oven have the same temperature controls, turn the oven heat to 425 degrees. Let the duck bake in the oven 10 minutes.</li>
<li>Turn the pieces skin side up and continue baking 10 minutes. Rub the outside of the duck skin with the garlic and then put the garlic in the baking dish. Continue baking five or 10 minutes and serve.</li>
