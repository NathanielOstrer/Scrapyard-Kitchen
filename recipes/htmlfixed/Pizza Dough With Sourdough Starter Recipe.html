<h3>Preparation</h3>
<ol class="recipe-steps" itemprop="recipeInstructions">
<li>Using your fingers, break the starter dough into 1-inch pieces in a bowl and mix with 1 cup room temperature water until soupy and chunky. In the bowl of a stand mixer, combine the flours and salt, then add the starter and water. Mix with a wooden spoon until the dough begins to bind, then let rest for 5 minutes. Using the dough hook, knead on the mixer’s second-lowest setting for 5 to 7 minutes, until dough pulls away from the bowl and becomes a smooth ball. Lift dough hook, scraping off any excess dough. Settle a sheet of plastic wrap on the dough, and let rest for 3 to 4 hours.</li>
<li>Cut dough into 4 8-ounce pieces. (For smaller pizzas, divide into 5 6-ounce pieces.) Turn each piece out on a floured surface, folding and kneading three or four times until it becomes a smooth ball. Place each piece in a plastic bin large enough to allow it to double in size, let a sheet of plastic wrap settle on the dough, and cover with a lid. Refrigerate for 48 hours, or at least 24 hours, before shaping and baking.</li>
