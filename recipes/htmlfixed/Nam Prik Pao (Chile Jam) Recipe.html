<h3>Preparation</h3>
<ol class="recipe-steps" itemprop="recipeInstructions">
<li>Combine the tamarind paste with 
1/2 cup very hot water, and break 
up the paste with a spoon or your 
fingers; soak for a few minutes, 
breaking up the paste a few more 
times if needed. Push the mixture 
through a mesh strainer with the back 
of a spoon; set aside the pulp 
that passes through the strainer, and 
discard what remains inside the 
strainer. Stem and seed the chiles.</li>
<li>Heat the oil in a wok or large 
skillet over medium-high heat until 
hot but not quite smoking. Add 
the chiles, and cook, stirring, for 15 
to 20 seconds, making sure they 
don’t burn. Remove with a slotted 
spoon, and transfer to a plate.</li>
<li>Add the garlic to the oil, and 
fry, stirring frequently, until just golden 
brown. (It will continue to brown 
after it’s out of the oil, so don’t go 
too dark now.) Transfer to the plate 
with the chiles. Fry the shallots 
until golden brown, and transfer to 
the plate. Turn off the heat, leaving 
the oil in the pan. Transfer the chiles, 
garlic and shallots to a food 
processor; pulse, scraping down 
the sides as necessary, until 
the mixture turns into a paste (no 
need to make it totally smooth).</li>
<li>Turn the heat under the pan to 
medium. Add the shrimp paste, and 
cook, stirring and breaking it up, 
for about a minute or 2. Add the palm 
sugar, and cook, stirring, until it 
dissolves. Add the chile, garlic and 
shallot mixture, the tamarind pulp 
and 2 tablespoons of the fish sauce. 
Stir to combine, turn the heat to low 
and cook, stirring occasionally so the 
bottom of the pan doesn’t burn, 
until it thickens slightly, 2 or 3 minutes. 
Taste the mixture; if it still needs salt, 
add more fish sauce, a little at a time.</li>
<li>You can store the jam (and the oil) 
in a jar in the fridge or freezer; use 
it in stir-fries or soups, spoon it on top 
of rice or noodles, spread it on toast 
or use it as the base for the yum yai 
dressing (recipe online).</li>
