<h3>Preparation</h3>
<ol class="recipe-steps" itemprop="recipeInstructions">
<li>Prepare four 1/2-pint jars: Wash jars, lids and rings in hot, soapy water and rinse well. Place jars in a 200-degree oven until needed. Put lids in a pan of boiling water, and cover until needed.

</li>
<li>Place a rack in the bottom of a large stockpot or canning bath. (Or put down a layer of lid rings.) Add enough water to cover jars by 2 to 3 inches (do not put jars in yet) and bring to a boil, then reduce heat. The water will need to be at about 180 degrees — a whispering boil — when jars are added for processing. Place two small saucers in freezer. </li>
<li>In a large saucepan, gently heat berries with 1/2 cup water until they burst their skins. Remove pan from heat, let cool slightly, and run berries through the coarse blade of a food mill.</li>
<li>Return purée to pan. Add sugar, lemon juice and cinnamon stick. Cook at a full boil, stirring constantly, until a gel set is achieved, 8 to 10 minutes; mixture will look jammy. To test, drop a teaspoon of the mixture onto a chilled saucer. Put in freezer for 1 minute. Push your finger through jam. If surface wrinkles, it is ready. (If not, cook a few minutes more and repeat with second saucer.) Discard cinnamon stick. Stir in lime juice and zest. </li>
<li>Ladle hot jam into jars, leaving 1/4-inch head space to allow contents to expand. Run a skewer or other thin tool around the jars’ inside edges to release bubbles or air pockets. Wipe rims clean with a damp paper towel, put flat lids in place, and screw on rings just until tight. </li>
<li>Using a jar lifter or tongs, lower sealed jars into water bath. Cover and rapidly bring water to a full rolling boil. Once water is boiling, boil jars for 10 more minutes.

</li>
<li>Turn off heat and remove jars from water bath. Place on a cutting board or folded dish towel and leave overnight. </li>
<li>The next morning, verify that jars have sealed. Remove ring and press on center of lid. If the lid moves, or if the “button” in the center flexes, the seal has failed to set. The jam is still safe to eat, but it is not suitable for shelf storage; put it in the refrigerator and use it first. Store sealed jars in a cool, dark place for up to 1 year. Refrigerate after opening.
