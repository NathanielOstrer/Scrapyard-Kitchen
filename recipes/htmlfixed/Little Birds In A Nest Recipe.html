<h3>Preparation</h3>
<ol class="recipe-steps" itemprop="recipeInstructions">
<li>Pound the meat into sheets about an eighth-inch-thick. Place a slice of prosciutto on each, lay a sage leaf in the center and roll tightly, pressing constantly, tucking in the sides to make compact cylinders roughly three-and-a-half-inches long. Set aside, uncovered.</li>
<li>Peel the eggplant and cut the flesh into large julienned strips - about the size of big french fries. Set aside.</li>
<li>Cut the zucchini into julienned strips slightly smaller than the eggplant. Set aside.</li>
<li>Put two tablespoons of the oil in a large, nonreactive saucepan over medium-high heat and heat until it almost smokes. Add the julienned eggplant, zucchini and salt, stirring well. Continue to cook, stirring often, until the eggplant is thoroughly soft and the zucchini barely translucent, about 15 minutes. The mixture may stick at first but will loosen as cooking proceeds. Remove the vegetables with a slotted spoon and keep them covered in a warm place. Reduce the heat to low.</li>
<li>If necessary, add just enough additional oil to the pan to film the bottom. Add the garlic and orange zest and cook, stirring, for three minutes. Stir in the orange juice and tomatoes and simmer over medium heat for about 12 minutes, or until the sauce is thick.</li>
<li>After the sauce has cooked five minutes, warm four large serving plates. Put the remaining tablespoon of oil in a wide, nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. When it shimmers, add the butter. Put in the beef rolls seam side down and cook until they are seared. Turn with tongs and continue cooking, shaking the pan, for about five minutes, or just until meat is nicely browned. Interior should remain pink. Remove the rolls, keeping them warm.</li>
<li>Pour the vermouth into the skillet and boil, stirring to get up all browned bits, until reduced to about two tablespoons. Stir in the tomato sauce and any juices collected under the vegetables.</li>
<li>Spread the sauce evenly over the plates. Make nests of the mixed vegetables and arrange two beef rolls on each. Serve at once.</li>
