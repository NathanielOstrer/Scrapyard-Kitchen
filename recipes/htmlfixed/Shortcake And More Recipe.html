<h3>Preparation</h3>
<ol class="recipe-steps" itemprop="recipeInstructions">
<li>For 4 people, use 2 cups or more of raw, well-rinsed berries - strawberries, raspberries, blackberries or a combination. Crush about half of them gently with a fork, just to set the juices running. Add sugar to taste, depending on the berries' sweetness and ripeness. Set them aside, covered, in a cool place for at least 30 minutes to develop flavor.</li>
<li>Gooseberries, another old-fashioned favorite for fool, must be cooked first. Stew 2 cups of gooseberries with about 1/2 cup of sugar just until the berries burst. Taste for sweetness, and add more sugar if necessary. Let cool before proceeding with the recipe.</li>
<li>Measure the crushed berries, and pour out an equal amount of whipping cream. Beat the cream just until it holds a gentle shape. Fold the berries into the cream so there is a pleasing contrast of dark berries and pale cream. Serve in a large glass bowl or in individual sorbet cups.</li>
