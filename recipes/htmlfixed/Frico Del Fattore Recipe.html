<h3>Preparation</h3>
<ol class="recipe-steps" itemprop="recipeInstructions">
<li>Saute bacon in a medium-size nonstick pan over medium heat until it gives up some of its fat. Add onion, and cook until onion begins to color.</li>
<li>Add potato, and stir well to coat. Add 3/4 cup water; reduce heat to low; cover, and cook, stirring once, about 15 minutes, until potatoes are soft and water has evaporated. Mixture should be fairly dry.</li>
<li>Add cheese, several pieces at a time, and stir continuously, adding more cheese as it melts. When cheese is almost completely melted, turn mixture into an 8-inch nonstick pan (nonstick surface should be perfect, or cheese will stick), and cook over low heat to brown bottom. As fat from cheese accumulates, spoon it off.</li>
<li>When bottom is browned, carefully flip onto plate, and then return frico to pan to brown the other side, about 20 minutes total. Remove, and cool slightly; cut into small wedges and serve warm or at room temperature.</li>
