<h3>Preparation</h3>
<ol class="recipe-steps" itemprop="recipeInstructions">
<li>It is best to prepare these sausages one day in advance and refrigerate them until ready to cook.</li>
<li>Cut away and reserve the meat from the ducks. There should be about 2 pounds of meat. Discard the bones and any fibrous membranes. Reserve 1/4 pound duck fat.</li>
<li>Cut the duck meat into 1-inch cubes and put in a mixing bowl. Chop up the duck fat and add it and the thyme, bay leaf, allspice, salt and pepper. Blend well.</li>
<li>If using a sausage stuffer, put half the duck mixture into the container of a food processor and blend until the mixture is slightly finer than hamburger. Repeat with the remainder. Combine the two batches and add the pistachios. Blend well in a bowl. Follow the manufacturer's instructions for filling the sausage casings. If using a meat grinder and stuffer, follow the manufacturer's instructions for stuffing the casings. When the filling has been added, pinch off the casing and tie a knot at each end. Tie a piece of string at 5- or 6-inch intervals. There should be 11 or 12 sausages. Wrap the sausages in clear plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight.</li>
<li>To cook, cut off as many lengths of sausage as desired. Prick each sausage all over, forming pin-sized holes. Grill or broil the sausages, turning as necessary, about 15 minutes or until done. Or preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Place the sausages in a skillet and add 1/8 inch water. Bring the water to a boil on top of the stove and place the skillet in the oven. Bake 15 to 20 minutes, turning once, or until the sausages are done.</li>

<span class="recipe-note-description">Duck legs may be substituted for whole ducks. Look for them in the grocery store or order them from D'Artagnan in Jersey City, which sells duck legs for $2.50 a pound; American Express, Visa and MasterCard are accepted. You will need five legs.</span>
