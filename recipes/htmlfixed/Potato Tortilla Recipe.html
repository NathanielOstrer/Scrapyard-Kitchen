<h3>Preparation</h3>
<ol class="recipe-steps" itemprop="recipeInstructions">
<li>Spread potatoes in a heavy flameproof casserole, cover with olive oil and sprinkle with salt. Spread onion on top. Place over medium-high heat until oil bubbles. Reduce heat and simmer, stirring gently once or twice, until potatoes are tender but not broken, 7 to 10 minutes.</li>
<li>Place a mesh colander over a heatproof bowl, and drain potatoes and onion, reserving oil. In a large bowl, whisk eggs until frothy. Add potato mixture to eggs and stir gently to combine.</li>
<li>Place an 8-inch nonstick pan or well-seasoned skillet over medium-high heat. Add 3 tablespoons reserved olive oil. Add one-third of the potato mixture and stir with wooden spoon or spatula. Cook until egg is barely set, about 30 seconds. Reduce heat to medium-low. Add another one-third of the mixture and stir for 15 seconds. Add remaining third and stir two or three times. Gently pat mixture to flatten it, and allow it sit until the top is loose, the center is somewhat firm and the bottom is firm (pale golden, not golden brown), about 30 seconds.</li>
<li>Run a spatula around perimeter of tortilla, shaking pan to be sure edges and bottom are free. Place a small flat plate that fits securely inside pan directly on top of tortilla. Wearing a kitchen mitt, grasp handle close to pan. In one quick movement, flip tortilla onto plate.</li>
<li>Quickly wipe out pan, add 2 tablespoons reserved olive oil, and return pan to medium-low heat until reheated. Slide tortilla back into reheated pan so the bottom is now the top. Pat down to compact layers of potatoes and eliminate air bubbles. When tortilla is set and bottom and edges are free of pan, use spatula or spoon to turn in the edges to give tortilla a more compact, attractive, shape. If desired, tortilla can be allowed to rest for 5 minutes on lowest possible heat, before turning onto a serving plate.</li>
<li>To serve, slice hot tortilla in large wedges. It may also be covered and refrigerated for up to 24 hours, then served cold with mayonnaise.</li>
