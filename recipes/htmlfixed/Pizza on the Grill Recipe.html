<h3>Preparation</h3>
<ol class="recipe-steps" itemprop="recipeInstructions">
<li>In the bowl of a stand mixer, or in a large bread bowl, dissolve the yeast in the water. Add the sugar and stir together. Let sit 2 or 3 minutes, until the water is cloudy. Stir in the olive oil.</li>
<li>Using a stand mixer: Combine 310 grams (2 1/2 cups) of the flour and the salt, and add to the yeast mixture all at once. Mix together using the paddle attachment, then change to the dough hook. Knead at low speed for 2 minutes, then turn up to medium speed and knead for 8 minutes.  Add flour as needed. Hold on to the machine if it bounces around. Turn out onto a clean work surface and shape the dough into a ball. The dough should be firm and slightly sticky. 
If you are kneading the dough by hand: Mmix together the yeast, sugar, water and olive oil as directed in a medium size or large bowl. Combine 310 grams (2 1/2 cups) of the flour and the salt. Fold in a cup at a time, using a large wooden spoon. As soon as you can scrape the dough out in one piece, turnscrape out onto a lightly floured work surface, and knead for 10 minutes, adding flour as necessary, until the dough is firm. Shape into a ball.</li>
<li>Transfer the dough to a clean, lightly oiled bowl, rounded side down first, then rounded side up. Cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap and leave it in a warm spot to rise for 1 to 1 1/2 hours, until doubled.</li>
<li>Weigh the dough and divide into 3 equal balls. Shape each ball by cupping it between your hands, with the bottom of your hands touching your work surface, and moving the dough in a clockwise circle between your hands, working round and round the dough until it becomes a ball. Put the balls on a lightly oiled baking sheet, cover with lightly oiled plastic wrap or a damp towel, and leave them to rest for 15 to 20 minutes. At this point, the dough balls can be placed in a wide bowl and covered with plastic wrap, or in a re-sealable bag, and refrigerated for 1 to 2 days. You will need to punch them down again when you are ready to roll out the pizzas.</li>
<li>Lightly flour the dough if it is sticky. While turning the dough, press down on its center from the heel of your hand to your fingertips, gradually spreading it out to an approximately 10-inch circle.  You can also stretch the dough by pressing it out and laying it over a closed fist; with your other hand, rotate it around, balancing it on the fist, while you gently stretch it out with your fingers. Do not shape a raised rim; the entire circle should be flat. You can also use a rolling pin to roll out the dough.</li>
<li>If not planning to grill right away, you can make these in advance and keep them in the freezer. Dust a piece of parchment with flour, semolina or cornmeal and place a rolled- out pizza shell on the parchment. Top with another piece of parchment and dust with flour, semolina or cornmeal. Stack the remaining two shaped pizza rounds between sheets of parchment, then wrap airtight in plastic and place in the freezer.</li>
</ol>
<h4 class="group-name">Grilling the pizza</h4>
<ol class="recipe-steps" itemprop="recipeInstructions">
<li>Prepare a hot grill. You will be placing the pizza directly over the heat. Next to the grill, sSet up a bowl of olive oil, some paper towels and tongs or a grill brush, next to your grill. Have your toppings ready. Lightly dust a baker’s peel or a rimless baking sheet with flour, cornmeal or semolina. Take your shaped pizzas from the freezer if you have stored them there. Place one on the peel or baking sheet.</li>
<li>When the grill is hot, oil the rack with olive oil, either by brushing with a grill brush or by dipping a folded wad of paper towels in olive oil and using tongs to rub the rack with it. Slide the pizza dough from the peel or baking sheet onto the grill rack. If the dough has just come from the freezer and is easy to handle, you can just place it on the rack without bothering with the peel. Close the lid of the grill – the vents should be closed —-- and set the timer for 2 minutes.</li>
<li>Lift up the grill lid. The surface of the dough should display some big air bubbles. Using tongs, lift the dough to see if it is evenly browning on the bottom. Rotate the dough to assure even browning. Keep it on the grill, moving it around as necessary, until it is nicely browned, with grill marks. Watch closely so that it doesn’t burn. When it is nicely browned on the bottom (it may be blackened in spots), use tongs or a spatula to slide the dough onto the baking sheet or peel, and remove from the grill.  Cover the grill again.</li>
<li>Make sure that there is still some flour on the peel or baking sheet and flip the dough over so that the uncooked side is now on the bottom. Brush the top lightly with oil, then top with a thin layer of tomato sauce (no more than 1/4 cup) and shreds or slices of mozzarella. Slide the pizza back onto the grill. If using a gas grill, reduce the heat to medium-high. Close the lid and cook for 2 to 3 more minutes, until the bottom is brown. Open the grill and check the pizza; if the cheese hasn’t melted, leave for a few more minutes. If the bottom is getting too dark, move the pizza to a cooler part of the grill and close the top. Use a spatula or tongs to remove the pizza to a cutting board. Arrange fresh basil leaves on top, cut into wedges and serve.</li>
