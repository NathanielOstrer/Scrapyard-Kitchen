<h3>Preparation</h3>
<ol class="recipe-steps" itemprop="recipeInstructions">
<li>Put olive oil in a large, deep skillet or casserole that can be covered, and turn heat to high. A minute later, add garlic and chilies. When they sizzle, add ribs, meatier side down; sprinkle with salt and pepper, and add bay leaves. Cook, adjusting heat so the meat browns, 5 to 10 minutes. Turn ribs, and brown again. Remove ribs to a plate.</li>
<li>Pour off excess fat, and add cabbage and some more salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until cabbage browns. Add wine, and stir to release any brown bits stuck to bottom of pan. Return ribs to pot; adjust heat so mixture simmers steadily but not violently, and cover.</li>
<li>Cook, checking occasionally to be sure the mixture does not dry out. (If it does, add more white wine or water.) When ribs are tender and cabbage is very soft -- this will take at least 45 minutes -- uncover. If mixture is soupy, turn heat to high, and cook, stirring occasionally and carefully, until it is more of a moist stew. Garnish with parsley and serve immediately, or cover and refrigerate for up to a day before reheating.</li>
