<h3>Preparation</h3>
<ol class="recipe-steps" itemprop="recipeInstructions">
<li>Prepare the sweet potatoes while you heat the oil in a wok, deep-fryer or deep frying pan to 360 to 375 degrees. Use a deep-fry thermometer to measure the temperature. Cook a handful of sweet potato slices at a time. They are ready as soon as the edges curl and brown, which should take no more than a minute and probably will take much less. Do not crowd the pan.</li>
<li>Using a deep-fry skimmer, remove from the oil and drain on paper towels on a rack. Allow the oil to come back up to 360 to 375 degrees between batches. Season with salt if desired and serve.</li>

<span class="recipe-note-description">Advance preparation: You can slice the sweet potatoes an hour or two before you fry them, but they should be served right away.

Many chefs reuse their oil, if it has not reached the smoke point. I usually do not, but if you do, strain it once it has cooled through a cheesecloth-lined strainer and keep in the refrigerator. You can use it one or two more times. To discard it, I empty the oil into a plastic bag, container, or jar once cooled, seal it and throw it in the trash.</span>
