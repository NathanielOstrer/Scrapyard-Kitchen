<h3>Preparation</h3>
<ol class="recipe-steps" itemprop="recipeInstructions">
<li>Place whole unpeeled potatoes in a pot. Cover with cold water by at least 2 inches. Bring to a boil over high heat. As soon as water boils, set a timer and cook potatoes for 10 minutes. Drain, cover with cold water, and let cool to room temperature. (This can be done up to 1 day ahead. Do not refrigerate.)</li>
<li>Heat oven to 425 degrees. Combine oil, garlic and paprika in a bowl or measuring cup. Have a pastry brush ready.</li>
<li>Place a potato on a large spoon. Use a sharp knife to make 1/8-inch-thick slices in the potato, crosswise, without cutting through the bottom, so potato remains intact. The sides of the spoon will prevent the blade from going too far down. (Or, rest potato on counter and line up a chopstick on each side to block the knife.) Don’t worry if the potato skin starts to shred; it will look fine after baking. Repeat with remaining potatoes.</li>
<li>Place potatoes on a piece of foil and brush generously with the paprika oil, using fingers to separate slices and let oil drip down. Sprinkle with salt, making sure that it gets between the slices.</li>
<li>Place on a baking sheet and bake 20 minutes. Remove from oven and brush again with oil. Use oven mitts to gently squeeze potato and open up the slices. Sprinkle again with salt. Bake 10 to 20 minutes more, until potatoes are cooked through. Serve whole or half potatoes.</li>
