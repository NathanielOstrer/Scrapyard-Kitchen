<h3>Preparation</h3>
<ol class="recipe-steps" itemprop="recipeInstructions">
<li>Bring a large pot of water to a boil while you strip leaves from chard ribs. Wash leaves in 2 changes of water and cut ribs into 1/4-inch dice. You should have about 1 cup diced chard ribs.</li>
<li>When water comes to a boil salt generously and add chard leaves. Blanch just until wilted, about 1 minute. Transfer to a bowl of cold water, drain and squeeze out excess water, taking chard up by the handful. Chop medium-fine and set aside. You should have about 1 cup chopped blanched chard.</li>
<li>In a large, heavy skillet heat 2 tablespoons olive oil over medium-high heat and add diced chard ribs. Sauté for 1 to 2 minutes and add squash. Allow to brown in the pan without stirring for a couple of minutes, then toss in the pan and sauté for 10 minutes, tossing or stirring in the pan occasionally. Season with salt and continue to cook, tossing or stirring in the pan occasionally, for another 8 to 10 minutes, until tender and lightly colored. Add remaining teaspoon of olive oil and garlic, chard and Aleppo pepper and toss together. Cook, stirring often, for another 3 to 4 minutes, until chard is evenly distributed throughout and garlic is fragrant. Add quinoa and toss together until evenly distributed and warmed through. Taste and adjust seasoning. Remove from heat and serve.</li>
