<h3>Preparation</h3>
<ol class="recipe-steps" itemprop="recipeInstructions">
<li>Pat the chops dry, and rub them all
over with a mixture of the rosemary, salt,
pepper and garlic. Cover, and marinate
for up to 2 hours at room temperature, or overnight in the refrigerator. Bring
the chops back to room temperature
before grilling.</li>
<li>Heat one side of a charcoal or gas grill,
and put the rack about 4 inches from
the heat source. Cook the chops over the
hottest part of the fi re until well seared
on both sides, about 3 or 4 minutes per
side. Move them to the cool part of the
grill, cover and cook until done, anywhere
from 1 to 10 minutes, depending on
the heat of the fi re and the thickness of
the chops. The pork is done when it’s
just fi rm to the touch, its juices run just
slightly pink and the meat is rosy
in the center, or when an instant-read
thermometer registers 135 degrees
in the thickest part of the chop (the
temperature will continue to rise as the
chops rest). Transfer them to a platter,
cover loosely with aluminum foil and let
them rest while you make the sauce.</li>
<li>Put 1 tablespoon of the butter in a
skillet over medium-high heat. When the
foam subsides, add the shallots, and
cook until soft, 2 or 3 minutes. Add the
cherries, wine and whatever juices
have accumulated around the pork chops;
cook, stirring occasionally, until the
liquid reduces into a thin syrup, 5 or 6
minutes. Stir in the remaining 2
tablespoons butter, a little at a time, until
it’s incorporated into the sauce. Season
with salt and pepper. Pour the sauce over
the chops, and serve.</li>
