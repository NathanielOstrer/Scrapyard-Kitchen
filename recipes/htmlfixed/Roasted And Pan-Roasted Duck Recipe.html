<h3>Preparation</h3>
<ol class="recipe-steps" itemprop="recipeInstructions">
<li>Preheat oven to 425 degrees. Season duck generously inside and out with salt and pepper. Place onions and rosemary in cavity. Truss duck. Heat small roasting pan in oven for 10 minutes. Place duck in pan; roast for 1 hour and 10 minutes, basting occasionally with pan juices. Remove duck, and cool to room temperature. Quarter the duck, trimming off any excess fat. Discard onions and rosemary. Cover duck with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for up to 24 hours.</li>
<li>If drippings in pan have burned, you cannot make a sauce from it. If they have not burned, skim off as much fat as possible, and place pan over high heat. Add 1 cup water; bring to boil, stirring to loosen any pan drippings. Reduce by half. Taste, and adjust seasoning. Set aside until serving.</li>
<li>To serve, preheat oven to 450 degrees. Heat ovenproof skillet over medium-high heat; add duck pieces, skin side down. Saute until skin begins to sizzle and brown, for about 1 minute. Reduce heat to low; crisp skin for 5 to 7 minutes. Cover with lid or foil; transfer to oven for 10 minutes, to heat through and to continue browning skin. Transfer to platter; serve with warmed sauce.</li>
