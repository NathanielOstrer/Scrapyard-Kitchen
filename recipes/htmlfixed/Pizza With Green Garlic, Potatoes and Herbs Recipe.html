<h3>Preparation</h3>
<h4 class="group-name">For the whole wheat pizza dough</h4>
<ol class="recipe-steps" itemprop="recipeInstructions">
<li>Combine the yeast and water in a 2-cup Pyrex measuring cup. Add the sugar, and stir together. Let sit two or three minutes, until the water is cloudy. Stir in the olive oil.</li>
<li>Combine the whole wheat flour, all-purpose flour and salt in a food processor fitted with the steel blade. Pulse once or twice. Then, with the machine running, pour in the yeast mixture. Process until the dough forms a ball on the blades. Remove from the processor (the dough will be a little tacky; flour or moisten your hands so it won’t stick), and knead on a lightly floured surface for a couple of minutes, adding flour as necessary for a smooth dough.</li>
<li>Shape the dough into a ball, pinched at bottom and rounded at top. Transfer the dough to a clean, lightly oiled bowl, rounded side down first, then rounded side up. Cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap, and leave it in a warm spot to rise for 1 to 1 1/2 hours. When it is ready, the dough will stretch when it is gently pulled.</li>
<li>Divide the dough into two equal balls. Put the balls on a lightly oiled tray or platter, cover with lightly oiled plastic wrap or a damp towel, and leave them to rest for 15 to 20 minutes. Afterward, the dough balls can be placed in a wide bowl, covered with plastic wrap and refrigerated for up to three days. Alternatively, you can wrap them loosely in lightly oiled plastic wrap and refrigerate them in a resealable plastic bag. When you are ready to roll out the pizzas, you will need to bring the balls to room temperature and punch them down again.</li>
<li>Preheat the oven to 450 degrees. Place a pizza stone on the middle rack of the oven. Roll or press out the dough to a 12- to 14-inch circle. Lightly oil pizza pans, and dust with semolina or cornmeal. Place the dough on the pizza pan. With your fingers, form a slightly thicker raised rim around edge of the circle. Brush everything but the rim with a little olive oil, then top the pizza with the toppings of your choice.</li>
<li>Place the pizza pan on the stone. Bake as directed.</li>
<li>Bring a medium pot of salted water to a boil, and drop in the garlic. Blanch for 30 seconds, and transfer to a bowl of cold water using a slotted spoon. Drain and dry on paper towels.</li>
</ol>
<h4 class="group-name">For the pizza with green garlic, potatoes and herbs</h4>
<ol class="recipe-steps" itemprop="recipeInstructions">
<li>Add the potatoes to the pot, and bring to a gentle boil. Cover partially, and simmer the potatoes until just tender when pierced with a knife — 10 to 15 minutes, depending on the size of the potatoes. Drain and rinse with cold water. When cool enough to handle, slice about 1/4 inch thick.</li>
<li>Preheat the oven to 450 degrees with a baking stone inside. Roll or press out the pizza dough, and line a 12- to 14-inch pan. Brush all but the rim of the crust with 1 tablespoon of olive oil, and sprinkle on the Parmesan. Top with the sliced potatoes and sliced garlic. Season generously with salt and pepper, and sprinkle withthe rosemary or oregano. Drizzle on the remaining olive oil. Bake until the crust is browned and crisp, about 15 minutes. Serve hot or at room temperature.</li>

              Tips
            </h4>
<ul class="recipe-notes">
<li>
<span class="recipe-note-description">Advance preparation: The pizza dough can be refrigerated after the first rise for up to three days (see step 4). The rolled out dough can be frozen. Transfer directly from the freezer to the oven.</span>
</li>
<li>
<span class="recipe-note-description">Advance preparation: The cooked potatoes and blanched garlic will keep for a day or two in the refrigerator. The dough can be made up to three days ahead and kept in the refrigerator.
