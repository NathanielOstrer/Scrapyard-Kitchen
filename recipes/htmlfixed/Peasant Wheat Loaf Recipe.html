<h3>Preparation</h3>
<ol class="recipe-steps" itemprop="recipeInstructions">
<li>Place flours, yeast and salt in a Cuisinart food processor fitted with a metal blade, and whirl to blend. Using an instant-read thermometer, determine the temperature of the flour.</li>
<li>Measure 1 1/4 cups water, adjusting the temperature of the water so that when its temperature and that of the flour are added together, the total is 130.</li>
<li>Pour in the starter and, with the machine running, pour in the water through the feed tube and process 20 seconds. If the dough seems dry and does not come together to form a ball, add 2 more tablespoons water.</li>
<li>Process the dough for another 25 seconds. Test the temperature; it should be 75 to 80 degrees. If it is lower, process it at 5-second intervals until it warms. If it is higher, refrigerate for 5 to 10 minutes.</li>
<li>Place the dough in a bowl, cover with plastic wrap and set aside at room temperature for 3 hours. Turn it onto a lightly floured board, shape it into a round loaf and place it, seam side up, in a well-floured round banneton or a cloth-lined basket. Dust with flour, cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate 12 to 16 hours.</li>
<li>Remove the basket of dough from the refrigerator, and leave at room temperature 1 to 2 hours, until it is about 62 degrees and springs back very slowly when pressed.</li>
<li>One hour before baking, place a baking stone on a low oven rack and a pan for water on the oven floor. Preheat oven to 475 degrees.</li>
<li>Turn the loaf out, seam side down, onto a bakers' peel heavily dusted with cornmeal. Make four 1/2-inch-deep slashes in the top of the loaf, forming a large square. Dust lightly with flour.</li>
<li>Pour a cup of hot water into the pan on the bottom of the oven. Slide the loaf directly onto the stone. Reduce heat to 450 degrees, and bake 2 minutes. Add another cup of water to the pan, and bake 15 minutes. Rotate the bread so it bakes evenly, and bake another 25 to 30 minutes, until the bread is a deep brown and the internal temperature has reached about 205 degrees. (Reduce the oven temperature to 400 degrees during the last 20 minutes if the bread is browning too fast.)</li>
<li>Remove the bread from the oven, and cool completely on a rack before cutting.</li>
