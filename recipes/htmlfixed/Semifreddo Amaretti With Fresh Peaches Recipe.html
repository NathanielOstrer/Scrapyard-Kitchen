<h3>Preparation</h3>
<ol class="recipe-steps" itemprop="recipeInstructions">
<li>In the bowl of an electric mixer, beat the egg yolks until they thicken. Add the half-cup of amaretti crumbs and continue beating for five minutes, scraping the sides of the bowl periodically, until the color of the mixture becomes light and the texture quite thick. Stir in the liqueur, if desired.</li>
<li>In a clean, dry bowl, beat the egg whites at medium speed until they foam. With the mixer at high speed, slowly add one-half cup of confectioner's sugar. Continue beating until the egg whites hold firm - but not stiff -peaks, about three more minutes.</li>
<li>In a chilled bowl, beat the cream until it forms soft - but not stiff -peaks.</li>
<li>Fold together the egg whites and the cream.</li>
<li>Fold one quarter of the cream and egg white mixture into the egg yolks until they are well blended. Fold in the rest of the cream and egg white mixture by halves, deflating the mixture as little as possible.</li>
<li>Turn the mixture into custard cups, individual molds, a loaf pan or an ice-cube tray without the separator. Cover well with plastic. Freeze for two to three hours. Semifreddo will keep in freezer for several weeks.</li>
<li>When ready to serve, plunge the peaches into boiling water for 15 seconds. Rinse under cold water, peel and slice very thinly. Toss with lemon juice and the remaining one-half cup confectioner's sugar, adding sugar according to taste.</li>
<li>Dip the molds (or mold) briefly into hot water and turn out the semifreddo. Serve individual portions or slices of semifreddo, surrounded by peach slices. Garnish the semifreddo (but not the peaches) with broken pieces of amaretti.</li>
