<h3>Preparation</h3>
<ol class="recipe-steps" itemprop="recipeInstructions">
<li>To make the starter: In a tall, narrow,
nonmetal container (a tall, narrow bowl is
fine), mix 2/3 cup rye flour with 1/2 cup
water, along with the tiniest pinch of instant
yeast — less than 1/16 teaspoon. Cover
and let sit for about 24 hours, then add
the same amount of both flour and
water (no more yeast). Repeat twice more,
at 24-hour intervals; 24 hours after
the fourth addition, you have your starter.
(From now on, keep it in the refrigerator;
you don’t need to proceed with the
recipe for a day or two if you don’t want
to. Before making the dough, take a
ladleful — 1/2 to 3/4 cup — of the starter and
put it in a container; stir in 1/2 cup rye
flour and a scant 1/2 cup water, mix well,
cover and refrigerate for future use. This starter will
keep for a couple of weeks. If you don’t
use it during that time and you wish
to keep it alive, add 1/2 cup each flour
and water every week or so and stir; you
can discard a portion of it if it becomes
too voluminous.)</li>
<li>To make the dough: Combine the remaining starter in a big bowl with the rye flour, the whole-wheat or white flour and 2 1/4 cups water.</li>
<li>Mix well, cover with plastic wrap and
let sit overnight, up to 12 hours.</li>
<li>The next morning, the dough should
be bubbly and lovely. Add the salt, the cracked rye and 1 cup water — it will be
more of a thick batter than a dough and
should be pretty much pourable.</li>
<li>Pour and scrape it into two 8-by-4-inch
nonstick loaf pans. The batter should come
to within an inch of the top, no higher.</li>
<li>Cover (an improvised dome is better
than plastic wrap; the dough will stick to
whatever it touches) and let rest until it
reaches the rim of the pans, about 2 to 3
hours, usually. Preheat the oven to 325
and bake until a skewer comes out almost
clean; the internal temperature will
measure between 190 and 200. This will
take about 1 1/2 hours or a little longer.</li>
<li>Remove loaves from the pans and
cool on a rack. Wrap in plastic and let sit
for a day before slicing, if you can
manage that; the texture is definitely
better the next day.</li>
