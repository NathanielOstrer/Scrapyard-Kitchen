<h3>Preparation</h3>
<ol class="recipe-steps" itemprop="recipeInstructions">
<li>In a blender or food processor, pulse the peanuts until they are crushed and just starting to clump together.</li>
<li>Cut off the ends of the plantains, and slit open the skins with a sharp knife. Peel and cut plantains into 1 1⁄2-inch pieces. Place 2⁄3 of the cut plantains in a pot with enough water to cover by 1 inch, and bring to a boil over high heat. Salt the water until it tastes pleasant. Boil the plantains until they are cooked through, pierceable with a fork but not soft, about 30 minutes. Drain, and let cool to warm.</li>
<li>Using the large-holed grating blade of a food processor (or box grater), grate the raw plantain, and then grate the cooked. Transfer the plantains to a mixing bowl, and stir in the peanuts, 1 1⁄2 teaspoons achiote, cilantro and 2 teaspoons kosher salt, or to taste.</li>
<li>In a food processor, mince the garlic, onion and green pepper, then add the tomatoes and process until puréed. Chill a mixing bowl in the freezer.</li>
<li>Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a large sauté pan over medium high heat with remaining 1 teaspoon achiote, and when the oil is hot, add the tomato mixture and 1 teaspoon kosher salt. Stir occasionally, making sure the bottom of the pan doesn’t scorch. Cook at a boil until there is no juice left in the pan, but the mixture is still very moist, about 12 minutes.</li>
<li>Season fish with salt. Lower heat to low, add the fish to the sauce and cook, stirring occasionally, until it just flakes when you press it, about 3 minutes. Chop the mixture up in the pan with a spoon or spatula, and salt to taste. Remove the filling to the cold bowl, and let cool.</li>
<li>Lightly dampen your hands. Take about 1⁄4 cup of the plantain mixture, and flatten it in your hand to 1⁄2-inch thick. Press a long divot in the center of the plantain. Add 2 teaspoons of the filling to the center, and gently fold the plantain around the filling to encase it in a little football shape. Repeat until you’ve used all the plantain; extra filling is delicious for snacking.</li>
<li>Pour a scant 1⁄2-inch depth of oil into a large, wide sauté pan, and heat over medium-high heat until the oil is shimmering (350 degrees). Carefully place about half the corviches into the oil, making sure to leave a little room between each one. Fry for about 2 minutes per side, until deep golden brown. Turn them twice to fry on 3 sides. Remove them to a paper-towel-lined platter. Repeat with remaining corviches. Serve hot or at room temperature with the ají Cuencano (recipe <a href="http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1017829-aji-cuencano">here</a>).</li>
