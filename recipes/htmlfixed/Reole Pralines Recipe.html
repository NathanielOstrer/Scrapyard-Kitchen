<h3>Preparation</h3>
<ol class="recipe-steps" itemprop="recipeInstructions">
<li>Brush the inside of two baking sheets all over with a little melted butter.</li>
<li>It is not imperative that you use a candy thermometer to prepare these pralines, but a thermometer is very much of an asset. It is also preferable that you cook the candy on a metal heat-control pad, the best-known brand of which is Flame-Tamer. This distributes the heat evenly and discourages burning.</li>
<li>Combine the brown sugar, granulated sugar, butter, cream, milk and syrup in a saucepan and bring to the boil, stirring. Cook about 20 minutes, stirring constantly and checking the temperature often if a thermometer is used. When the candy achieves the soft-ball stage, the syrup will form a soft ball when a small portion is dropped into a basin of cold water and registers 235 degrees on the thermometer. Do not exceed that temperature at this point. Add the pecans and continue cooking, stirring constantly, until a temperature of 240 degrees - no more - is achieved. When ready, the syrup will have a non-glossy, lusterless look. Work quickly at this point.</li>
<li>Remove the saucepan from the heat while beating. Take care that the candy does not harden. Use two spoons and spoon about four teaspoons of the mixture at a time onto the buttered baking sheets, spacing the mounds about three inches apart to allow the rounds to spread to about two and one-half inches in diameter. Let cool and transfer the pralines to a dessert plate, using a wide metal spatula. The pralines should be crumbly and not chewy.</li>

<span class="recipe-note-description">To toast pecans, preheat the oven to 425 degrees. Scatter the pecan pieces in one layer in a baking pan and place in the upper part of the oven. Bake four to five minutes or until the pecans are crisp. Check often as they bake to make certain they do not burn.</span>
