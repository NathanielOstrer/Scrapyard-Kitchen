<h3>Preparation</h3>
<ol class="recipe-steps" itemprop="recipeInstructions">
<li>With oven rack in lowest position, heat oven to 200. Bring 10 cups water to boil in heavy, covered one-gallon Dutch oven. Remove lid, and with slotted spoon lower eggs quickly into water two at a time. Turn off heat, and replace lid. Set timer for 10 minutes. For a firmer egg, leave eggs in water 2 minutes more.</li>
<li>Fill a gallon bowl with very cold water, and set aside. Place 4 small bowls or wine glasses in oven to warm. Two minutes before eggs are done, toast bread, and butter it. Tear toast into small pieces, and place in warm bowl. If using wine glasses, serve toast on side.</li>
<li>When eggs are done, transfer them quickly with slotted spoon to bowl with cold water. After 5 seconds, remove eggs to a few thicknesses of paper towel.</li>
<li>With a small sharp knife, strike quickly through shell lengthwise. Drizzle yolk from shell onto toast in bowl or into cocktail glass. Scoop out white with spoon. Repeat with remaining eggs, using two for each serving. Sprinkle eggs with salt and pepper, and serve.</li>
