<h3>Preparation</h3>
<ol class="recipe-steps" itemprop="recipeInstructions">
<li>Put the yeast in the bowl of a 
standing mixer. Add 1 2/3 cups 
lukewarm water and allow the 
yeast to activate, about 5 
minutes. Add  flour, salt and malt 
powder and mix at low speed for 
5 minutes using the paddle 
attachment. Cover the dough and 
allow to rise at room temperature 
for about 2 hours.</li>
<li>Punch the dough down and 
shape into a rough rectangle 
about 1 to 1 1/2 inches thick, and 
about 2 times longer than it is 
wide. If you are having trouble 
forming the dough, stretch it, wait 
for the gluten to relax and reform.</li>
<li>Cut the dough into 10 pieces of 
about 3 ounces each. Roll each 
into an 8-inch-long snakelike 
shape, tapering the dough at 
each end. Circle the dough 
around your hand, pinching the 
ends together and rolling under 
your palm once or twice to seal. 
Put the bagels on a Silpat or other 
nonstick baking sheet on top of a 
jellyroll pan. Cover well with 
plastic wrap and refrigerate for 
about 10 hours, or up to 24 
hours.</li>
<li>Heat the oven to 425 degrees. 
If you have a baking stone or brick 
you use for baking, put it on a 
rack near the bottom of the oven; 
it will retain heat and produce a 
crisper bagel. Bring a large pot of 
water to boil, throw a handful of 
salt into the boiling water and 
remove the bagels from the refrigerator.</li>
<li>Using your hands, carefully 
place just enough bagels into the 
pot to cover the surface of the 
water, making sure that there are 
no bagels resting on top of one 
another. Let them float on one 
side for about 30 seconds before 
flipping them to the other side for 
another 30 seconds or so. 
Remove the bagels and drain well 
on a cooling rack.</li>
<li>Pour poppy or sesame seeds 
into a bowl wider than the bagels. 
Working very quickly, remove the 
bagels one by one and dip them 
into the topping. Place them back 
on the Silpat-covered baking 
sheet, topping side down.</li>
<li>Bake on the second to highest 
shelf of the oven for about 7 
minutes. Then flip the bagels and 
continue baking for about 8 
minutes, or until they are golden 
brown.</li>
