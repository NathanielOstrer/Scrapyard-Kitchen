<h3>Preparation</h3>
<ol class="recipe-steps" itemprop="recipeInstructions">
<li>Sprinkle the meat liberally with salt and pepper. Refrigerate overnight, uncovered.</li>
<li>When you’re ready to cook, rinse the meat in cold water; if you’re using the
oven (see next step), heat to 300. Put the fat in a pot that will allow you to submerge the meat, or nearly so. If you’re using lard or duck fat, heat it in
the oven until melted; if you’re using oil, warm it.</li>
<li>Submerge the meat in the fat, put a piece of parchment paper directly on
top and weigh the paper down with something (I used a wooden spoon) to
keep it in place. Cook slowly on top of the stove or in the oven, adjusting the
heat as necessary so the fat bubbles gently — not rapidly — and turning the
meat once or twice if it is not completely submerged. (You may wind up cooking at a temperature as low as 250.) It’s done when you can easily pierce it with a skewer, 2 hours or longer for cheek and
belly, 1 hour for turkey.</li>
<li>Remove the meat from the fat. Proceed or refrigerate the meat, lightly
covered, for a day or two. Heat the oven to 350. (If you’re using turkey, drizzle
the bread with olive oil.) Place the meat skin-side up directly on top of the
slice of bread (you want the meat to just cover the bread; any bread that’s
exposed may burn). Put on a rack set over a rimmed baking sheet and roast,
checking occasionally and adjusting the heat as necessary, until the skin
becomes quite crisp, as little as 45 minutes or somewhat longer. Remove.</li>
<li>Meanwhile, whisk together the olive oil, vinegar, mustard, capers, salt and pepper. Taste and adjust the seasoning; the dressing should be quite sharp.
Wash and dry the greens. If you’re using turkey, pull out the thigh bones (they
should slip out easily). With the meat still on top of the bread, chop the meat
and bread into bite-size pieces (it doesn’t matter if it crumbles a bit). Toss with
the greens and the dressing, and serve.</li>
