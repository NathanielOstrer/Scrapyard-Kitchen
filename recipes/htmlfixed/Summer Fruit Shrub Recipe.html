<h3>Preparation</h3>
<ol class="recipe-steps" itemprop="recipeInstructions">
<li>Mix fruit and sugar in a glass or other nonplastic bowl, breaking apart or mashing the fruit to bring out its juices. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 24 hours.</li>
<li>Stir the mixture well, add vinegar and chill. The shrub can be strained and used at this point, but it will take on more of the characteristics of the fruit if it sits for a few days. When ready to use, stir well to make sure sugar is dissolved, then strain using a fine sieve, pressing the solids to get all of the juice.</li>
<li>Pour the mixture into a clean Mason jar or funnel into a glass bottle with a stopper or cork.</li>
<li>To prepare a drink, add 1 part shrub to 2 or 3 parts seltzer or ginger beer and serve over ice.</li>
</ol>
