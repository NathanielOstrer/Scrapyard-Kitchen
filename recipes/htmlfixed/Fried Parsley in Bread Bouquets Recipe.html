<h3>Preparation</h3>
<ol class="recipe-steps" itemprop="recipeInstructions">
<li>Cut the parsley into long sprigs of equal length. Be sure there is no surface moisture on them or they will spit nastily when they hit the hot oil.</li>
<li>Using a clean coping saw or other small, fine saw, cut the bread sticks into 3/4-inch lengths. Keep cutting until you have about twice as many sections as you have plates to garnish.</li>
<li>Holding a 1/4-inch twist drill with your fingers, carefully drill out the center of each bread section so that it becomes a miniature "neckerchief slide."</li>
<li>Carefully insert the stems of a few parsley sprigs in each "slide" using as many sprigs as you need to make a snug-fitting bouquet of them.</li>
<li>To fry, simply drop these bouquets, a few at a time, into hot (370-degree) oil for about 10 seconds. Remove, drain, salt and serve as a garnish.</li>
