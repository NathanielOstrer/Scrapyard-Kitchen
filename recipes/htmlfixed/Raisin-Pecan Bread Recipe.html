<h3>Preparation</h3>
<ol class="recipe-steps" itemprop="recipeInstructions">
<li>Combine the raisins and boiling water in a bowl and set aside for 10 minutes. In the container of a food processor, combine 1/2cup of the pecan halves and sugar and pulse until the pecans are very finely ground. Set aside. Thoroughly drain the raisins and set them aside.</li>
<li>Place the warm water and yeast in a large bowl. Break the poolish into small pieces with your hands or a wooden spoon and add it to the bowl. Stir until fairly dissolved. Stir in the flour, ground pecans and sugar and salt. Stir until combined.</li>
<li>Turn the mixture out onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 10 minutes. Slowly begin to fold in the raisins and the remaining pecan halves a little at a time. Return the dough to the bowl, cover with a tea towel and let rise until doubled in bulk, 1 to 2 hours.</li>
<li>Gently turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and cut into 3 equal pieces. Leave the pieces on your work surface and cover them with a tea towel. Let them rest for 10 minutes.</li>
<li>Gently shape each piece into a short log and place the logs on a sheet pan lined with parchment paper. Cover with the tea towel and let rise until the loaves just hold a fingerprint when lightly pressed, 30 minutes to 1 hour.</li>
<li>When ready to bake, preheat oven to 375 degrees and have a plant sprayer full of fresh water ready. Using a single-sided razor at a 30-degree angle, slash the loaves diagonally with 2 3-inch slashes each. When the oven is hot, spray it thoroughly with water and immediately put the bread in and close the door. Spray the oven (not the bread) again 2 more times during the first 5 minutes of baking. Bake until bread is very brown and sounds hollow when the bottom is tapped, 25 to 30 minutes more.</li>
<li>Remove the loaves from the oven and cool them on a wire rack.</li>
