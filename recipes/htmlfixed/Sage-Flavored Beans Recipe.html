<h3>Preparation</h3>
<ol class="recipe-steps" itemprop="recipeInstructions">
<li>The night before cooking, soak beans in abundant water. (If there is not time, cover beans with water, bring to a boil, let boil 2 minutes and then soak for an hour.) Drain beans and discard soaking water. Cover beans with fresh boiling water.</li>
<li>Place beans over medium-low heat and add 3 cloves of peeled garlic, the sage and the olive oil.</li>
<li>Cover beans and leave to cook over gentle heat until beans are soft and tender, but not mushy, about 50 minutes. Check pan from time to time, and add a very little boiling water if it seems necessary.</li>
<li>If you are serving beans with roast lamb with garlic (see recipe), add them now, with their liquid, to the pot containing the onions, bacon and lamb. If you are not serving them with the lamb, continue cooking in their own liquid. Either way, add fourth clove of garlic, chopped, and salt and pepper. Simmer gently about 30 minutes. This should make a thick "sauce" to go with the lamb. If it is too watery, raise heat to further reduce the liquid before serving.</li>

<span class="recipe-note-description">Beans can be served on their own or as an accompaniment to lamb, another meat or chicken. They can also be served as a room-temperature salad, with extra oil, a sprinkle of balsamic vinegar and chips of raw red onion to garnish.</span>
