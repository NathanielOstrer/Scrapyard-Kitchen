<h3>Preparation</h3>
<ol class="recipe-steps" itemprop="recipeInstructions">
<li>Put the potatoes in a large pot and cover with cold water. Bring it to a simmer over medium heat and cook until tender, about 30 minutes. Meanwhile, fill a small saucepan with water and bring it to a boil. Lower the eggs into the water and simmer for 10 minutes. Drain the eggs and peel them under running water. Coarsely chop the eggs and add them to a large serving bowl.</li>
<li>Drain the potatoes, and when they are cool enough to handle, peel them, cut them into quarters lengthwise and then slice them thinly. Place them in the bowl with the eggs.</li>
<li>Add the pickles, celery, scallions, Miracle Whip and vinegar. Season with salt. Fold the salad together, again and again, until well blended. Taste as you go and adjust the salt if you need to.</li>
