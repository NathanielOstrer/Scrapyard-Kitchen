<h3>Preparation</h3>
<ol class="recipe-steps" itemprop="recipeInstructions">
<li>Cut each of the ducks or have them cut as follows: two breast pieces (the breast cut lengthwise down the center), two thighs, two legs, two wings, gizzard, liver, heart, neck and backbone. Using a sharp knife, place one piece at a time on a flat surface and cut away and reserve all the peripheral fat (the fat that extends beyond that covering the meat). Save all the cavity fat.</li>
<li>Put the pieces of fat into a heavy saucepan and cook over gentle heat without browning. You want to render the fat from the solids. The solid pieces will become quite crisp and nicely browned after about 45 minutes to an hour. Strain off the fat. There should be about two and one-half cups. Discard the solids.</li>
<li>Arrange the duck pieces in one layer in a large pan and sprinkle with pepper and salt. Sprinkle the pieces with the bay leaves, thyme, cloves and garlic, turning the pieces to coat them evenly with the ingredients. Arrange the pieces neatly, close together and cover with plastic wrap. Place in the refrigerator or a very cool place and let stand 24 to 48 hours.</li>
<li>When ready to cook, put the bony parts (back, necks and so on) on the bottom of a large saucepan or small casserole large enough to hold all the pieces. Place the meaty parts on top, all the pieces skin side down. Add the two and one-half cups of rendered duck fat and the lard. Cover closely and bring the fat to the boil. Let simmer about one hour and 15 minutes.</li>
<li>Remove the pieces of duck from the fat. Separate the meaty parts from the bony parts. You may pick at the bones if desired, but the choicest portions are, of course, the meaty parts. Preserved poultry or meats will keep for an extended period of time. To preserve them further, put the portions to be reserved in a utensil and add the hot fat to cover. Let stand at room temperature until cool. Refrigerate until ready to use.</li>
<li>When ready to use, heat the congealed fat until it is melted. Remove the pieces of duck and use as indicatd in any recipe calling for preserved duck.</li>
<li>To choose an example, heat four tablespoons of the duck fat in a large heavy skillet and add the duck pieces, skin side down. Cook about four or five minutes on one side or until nicely browned. Turn the pieces and continue cooking about four or five minutes until nicely browned on the second side.</li>
