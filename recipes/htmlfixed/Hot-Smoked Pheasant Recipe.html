<h3>Preparation</h3>
<ol class="recipe-steps" itemprop="recipeInstructions">
<li>Clean and truss the pheasants. Combine all ingredients for brine solution (see recipe below). Soak pheasants in brine for 24 hours.</li>
<li>Prepare smokehouse (see directions).</li>
<li>Pat each pheasant dry and brush with oil. Sprinkle liberally with paprika and, using a brush, spread it over the birds to give them an even color.</li>
<li>Place on rack in smokehouse at 200 degrees and maintain the heat in a range of 180 to 200 degrees for about six hours. Raise temperature in smokehouse to 220 to 240 degrees for one hour. Remove and allow to cool.</li>
<li>Serve chilled with freshly squeezed lemon juice or accompanied by cranberry sauce.</li>

<span class="recipe-note-description">This stores extremely well, at least a month under refrigeration. The same procedure can be used for turkey or chicken (without, of course, the necessity of hanging), but the smoking time would have to be increased depending on the bird's size.</span>
