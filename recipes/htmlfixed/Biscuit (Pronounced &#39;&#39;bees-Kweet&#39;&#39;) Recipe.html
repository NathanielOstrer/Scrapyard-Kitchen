<h3>Preparation</h3>
<ol class="recipe-steps" itemprop="recipeInstructions">
<li>Preheat oven to 275 degrees.</li>
<li>Grease a tube pan, such as a bundt pan or an angel-food cake pan, and sprinkle well with granulated sugar.</li>
<li>Beat egg whites until they form soft peaks. Continue to beat, adding sugar gradually, 1 tablespoon at a time, until egg whites are very stiff. In a separate bowl, beat the egg yolks until they are very light and lemon- colored. Add vanilla and mix well.</li>
<li>Fold a quarter of the sifted flour into the egg whites. Add a quarter of the egg yolks and fold gently. Continue adding the flour and egg yolks by fourths, folding gently after each addition. Make sure the mixture is thoroughly blended. Immediately turn into the cake pan, and place in the oven.</li>
<li>Bake for about an hour until the cake pulls away from sides of the pan. Remove from the oven, and immediately turn out of the pan onto a cake rack to cool.</li>
<li>Biscuit can be served sprinkled with sifted confectioners' sugar or with red-wine sauce.</li>
